Here we collect Fresnel diffraction methods based on boundary line integrals,
and include some comparsions between them and the main fresnaq areal method.

Specifically:

* bdwf.m of E. Cady, Opt Expr 2012, except we document it plus provide a version
with more general interface (target points not restricted to a grid).
 (bdwf.m.orig contains the original code pulled from SISTER pkg, 9/2/20.)

* our own much simpler and more accurate nsli (non-singular line intergral)
version.
