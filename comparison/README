Here we have comparisons of fresnap against other codes for a similar purpose.
We also test and document such codes themselves.
Specifically:

* bdwf.m of E. Cady, Opt Expr 2012, except we document it plus provide a version
with more general interface (target points not restricted to a grid).
 (bdwf.m.orig contains the original code pulled from SISTER pkg, 9/2/20.)
